\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we discuss the controversy of the formula of Bloom Filter. Three formulas of false positive probability are deduced: Bloom's formula, Bose's formular, and Christensen's formula. There is a error in the deduction process of Bose's formular, and there is a minor error in Bose's formular.  Christensen's formula is correct, but can only compute the false positive when $m$ is small, it cannot deduce the optimal value of $k$.


To compute the optimal value of $k$, we use information and entropy theory to get the exact formula of $k$.
To compute the false positive probability, 1) For small $m$, Christensen's formula can be used; 2)
For large $m$, we
prove a limit form of false positive probability using left and right limit, and find out that it is same as Bloom's. 
3) We also show that the error is negligible when $m$ is not large using two simple examples.
