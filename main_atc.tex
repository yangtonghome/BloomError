% Template for USENIX papers.
%
% History:
%
% - TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%   USENIX '05. originally a template for producing IEEE-format
%   articles using LaTeX. written by Matthew Ward, CS Department,
%   Worcester Polytechnic Institute. adapted by David Beazley for his
%   excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings, Tcl 96. turned into a
%   smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to both the
%   above pioneers. Use at your own risk. Complaints to /dev/null.
%   Make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point.
%
% - Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to
%   separate the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that
%   people can more easily include the .sty file into an existing
%   document. Also changed to more closely follow the style guidelines
%   as represented by the Word sample file.
%
% - Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you
%   want foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
%   usepackage command, below.
% - This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09
%   stuff.
%
% - Updated July 2018: Text block size changed from 6.5" to 7"
%
% - Updated Dec 2018 for ATC'19:
%
%   * Revised text to pass HotCRP's auto-formatting check, with
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.body_font_size=10pt, and
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.line_height=12pt
%
%   * Switched from \endnote-s to \footnote-s to match Usenix's policy.
%
%   * \section* => \begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of bibtex entires, to allow
%     this file to be compiled. (And changing refs style to 'plain'.)
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of figures, to
%     allow this file to be compiled. 
%
%   * Added packages for hyperref, embedding fonts, and improving
%     appearance.
%   
%   * Removed outdated text.
